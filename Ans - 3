To find the index where the target value should be inserted in a sorted array nums, we can use the binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem using binary search:

Initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the array nums, respectively.

While left is less than or equal to right, do the following:

Calculate the middle index mid as (left + right) // 2.
If nums[mid] is equal to the target, return mid as the index where the target is found.
If nums[mid] is less than the target, update left to mid + 1 to search the right half of the array.
If nums[mid] is greater than the target, update right to mid - 1 to search the left half of the array.
If the target is not found during the loop, return left as the index where the target should be inserted in order.

Here's the implementation in Python:


def searchInsert(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left
Let's test the function with the given example:


nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target = 5
result = searchInsert(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: 2
The function returns 2, which is the correct output for the given example. The target value 5 is found at index 2 in the nums array. If the target value was not found, the function would return the index where it should be inserted in order, which is also 2 in this case.
